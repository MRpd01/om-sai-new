## How to Add Images

1. Place the `HomeFoodImg.jpeg` file in: `public/images/HomeFoodImg.jpeg`
2. The page will automatically use it as the background
3. Test on both desktop and mobile to ensure it looks good

## Backup Plan

If you don't have a suitable image yet, the page will fall back to the gradient background which already looks professional.
